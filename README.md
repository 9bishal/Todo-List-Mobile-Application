# 📝 Todo List Mobile App

Hi! 👋
This is a **Todo List App** I made using **React Native + Expo**.
It helps me **remember things to do** so I don’t forget. 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

* ➕ Add a new task (with text + time)
* ⏰ Shows a **countdown timer** for each task
* 🔔 When time is up, it pops an **alert** → you can **complete** ✅ or **snooze** ⏸️
* ✅ Mark tasks as completed (they get a line through them)
* 📝 Edit or delete a task (change text or time)
* 🔄 Switch view → show only completed tasks or only active ones
* 📱 Cool UI with animations & floating add button
